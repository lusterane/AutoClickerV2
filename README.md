# HearthBot
A Personal Project Developed January 2018  
## What is it?
HearthBot is a script that automatically plays out a match by using Hero power on opponent. This is to automatically finish daily quests without the hassle of playing

3. GUI will open for you to select your current hero. Choose the corresponding hero
4. F2 to start script

## Help me improve!
If you do take the time to try out my program, let me know how I can improve my work! This was just a hobby project and my main interests dont lie
in scripting but I do believe that anything in the realm of programming will make me a better programmer so if you have any constructive feedback on what I could
improve on, feel free to let me know! Thank you
